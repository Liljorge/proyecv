<p>XML</p>
<p>I might give you a table of potential tags to use (like you saw in the first part of the XML project) and you would be required to use that diagram to create an XML instance document (root element, mid-level elements, attributes, and actual data content). The resulting XML instance document must be well-formed and it must conform to the table of potential tags that is provided.<strong>DO NOT FORGET that the XML tags CANNOT CONTAIN SPACES within the actual tag < XMLCommand>.</XMLCommand></strong> </p><br>
<p>I might also give you an XML file with errors in it, and you will need to make it well- formed. Make sure that you review the requirements of a well-formed instance document. <strong>NOT FORGET that the XML tags CANNOT CONTAIN SPACES within the actual tag < XMLCommand>.</strong></p><br>
<p><strong>MAKE SURE That you can CREATE ANY THING THAT YOU SAW/DID IN A TUTORIAL FILE OR THAT YOU WERE REQUIRED TO CREATE ON AN ASSIGNMENT.</strong></p>
